                This is Kenny, you have to help us, this company is not as it seems. <br></br>
                Unpaid workers, use of copyright material, weird experiments with AI, all of these seem to be going on underneath the surface. <br></br>
                You need to help us get word out, login with the admin username and password back in the original introduction page to access all of their unscrupulous doings and show it to the world. <br></br>
                All that I could do is to drop hints for you before they would find out. Please, free the rest as soon as possible before it is too late. <br></br>
